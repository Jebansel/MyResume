                    These are the projects that I have been able to complete in the last
                    two years that I have really enjoyed working on.</br></br> I am currently
                    working on an ecommerce website, so I can help my client move from
                    Etsy to their own website where they will be able to save money on
                    transaction fees, and build their own brand with their business.

                            Using spare hard drives that would have gone to waste to set up
                            a NAS for the home. Using the Raspberry Pi 4 to help set this
                            up, I have been able to use 2TB of storage that is now
                            accessible across my home network. </br></br>I am able to back up old
                            files and pictures without spending more money on upgrading my
                            cloud storage plans. </br></br>Furthermore, I wanted to make the NAS
                            accessible from outside the home network, so I was able to use
                            Wireguard to set up a VPN that allows me to connect to the home
                            network and still access all the necessary files.

                            This was my first Raspberry Pi project, but following a video I
                            found on youtube helped me to get started and set this up for my
                            family. </br></br>It was a challenge understanding how to work with my
                            network settings, and at first, I was not able to change the
                            DHCP settings from the router, so I had to individually change
                            the primary gateway and secondary gateway on each device.</br></br>
                            However, once I was able to set up a new mesh network in the
                            home, I was able to set up Pi Hole straight from the router,
                            making sure it covered all the devices connected to the home
                            network.

                            Web hosting was an interesting idea that I wanted to understand
                            more about, as I am keen to develop my skills and understanding
                            on web development so I wanted to set up a free website where I
                            can test my skills. </br></br>I decided to host my resume on this IP
                            address, once I made it public, instead of limiting it to only
                            my home network. Using my Raspberry Pi, I have been able to use
                            Ngnix to host this website. </br></br>Using a FTP server has helped me to
                            quickly update this website whenever I have been able to add a
                            new feature, so as my coding skills improve I am able to test
                            them out straight onto this website. Currently, I am working on
                            trying to set up a SSL certficate for the website to increase
                            security.

                            A family member currently sells her bunting on Etsy, but due to
                            Etsy's transaction fees, she is losing a large percentage with
                            each sale. </br></br>Therefore, by creating a website where she can sell
                            her items directly through the site, cutting out Etsy, she will
                            be able to maximise profits, whilst also building her brand
                            beyond just being another creator on Etsy. </br></br>I have been able to
                            make her some designs for how the website will look through
                            Canva, and she agreed that we could build on those designs
                            whilst also looking at other ecommerce websites for further
                            inspiration.
